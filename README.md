# Quantum-Computing-3SAT

In this repository, we have the files used in the bachelor's thesis Solving the 3-SAT problem using quantum algorithms done by Arnau Casau at FIB - UPC Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya.

The notebook uploaded is the implementation of Grover's algorithm using Qiskit. In this notebook, we can also find the code of the Quantum counting algorithm used to determine the number of iterations we need at Grover's and some explanations of the process. In the txt file, we can see the formula that the notebook reads.
